## Introduction

I am Jenni Jaatinen, a student in the University of Helsinki. My major is English philology which means I study a lot of linguistics and literature. With this degree you
get a good overall knowledge of English language, for example how it was formed and how it is used today. We have also studied the grammar and pronunciation of English.
Most people tend to veer towards either literature or linguistics after completing the basic studies and I have been studying a lot of literature.
In addition to English, I also study Spanish, which will be my minor. I also have an interest in language technology, which I have recently started to study.
I like to study literature and I also enjoy reading in my free time.
